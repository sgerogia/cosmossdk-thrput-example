# Cosmos SDK throughput demonstration

A simple Cosmos chain demonstrating throughput considerations and how to address them.

It is meant as a companion to my relevant [blog post "Cosmos chain throughput: From problem to solution"](https://sgerogia.github.io/Cosmos-Trx-Throughput/).

## Structure

The code is organised in branches (`main`, `v1`, `v2`,...) to show its evolution.  

### `main`

`main` contains the chain as generated by [Ignite CLI](https://ignite.com/cli), plus a simple `build.sh`.

The vanilla chain was generated with the following Ignite commands

```
# Chain creation
ignite scaffold chain throughput --address-prefix thrput --no-module --skip-git --path cosmossdk-throughput-example/
# Module creation
ignite scaffold module throughput --path cosmossdk-throughput-example/
# Message creation
ignite scaffold message some-action --desc "Some really complicated action" --module throughput --path ./cosmossdk-throughput-example/ 
```
